# Python Backend Foundations

This project is a backend-focused Python application designed to reinforce core backend engineering concepts without using a web framework.

The goal is to demonstrate clean architecture, separation of concerns, and service-based design that directly translates to modern backend frameworks like FastAPI or Django.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Data modeling with Python classes
- Service-layer architecture
- Validation and error handling
- Data persistence (repository pattern)
- Basic automated testing
- Clean project structure

models/ # Domain models (User, Task, etc.)
services/ # Business logic
storage/ # Data persistence layer
validators/ # Input validation
main.py # Application entry point
tests/ # Automated tests


## How to Run
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Run `python app/main.py`

## Why This Project Exists
This repository serves as a foundation for building real backend systems and as a stepping stone toward full-stack and API-based development.
